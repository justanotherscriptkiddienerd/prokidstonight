<p>In a right triangle, if the length of the opposite side is 4 units and the length of the adjacent side is 3 units, find the measure of the angle θ.

Solution:
Using the definition of tangent:

tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent
Substituting the given values:

tan(θ) = 4 / 3
Now, solving for θ:

θ = tan⁻¹(4/3) ≈ 53.13°</p>
